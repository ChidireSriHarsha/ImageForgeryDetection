Image Forensic for Digital Image Copy Move Forgery Detection
Due to advancement of Photoshop image editing we are experiencing more amount of Forgery images where portion of original image will be copy to another image to form new images. To detect such images forgery various algorithms are introduce such as SIFT, SVM and many more but this algorithms accuracy is high with 0 False prediction rate which means this algorithm are unable to identify between original and forge image. To overcome from this issue author is using advance image analysing concept such as Copy Move Forgery Detection (CMFD) which uses advance algorithms such as oriented Features from Accelerated Segment Test and rotated Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features (Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB)) as the feature extraction method and 2 Nearest Neighbour (2NN) with Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) as the feature matching method is proposed.   
Propose algorithm giving less accuracy with better False Positive Rate which indicates that propose algorithm is not classifying forge image into original image.
